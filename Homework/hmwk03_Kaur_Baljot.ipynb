So, if Tony competes in a 9-duel tournament and wins, he will take home \\$10,000 _minus_ \\$450 for Darth Ketelsen's fees, for a total payout of \\$9,550.

Assuming that Tony continues to use the service of Darth Ketelsen, and considering the fact that Tony has a better-than-even chance of winning each duel, explain the trade-offs between choosing a short series vs. a long series in terms of Expected Payout.
